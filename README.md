My Burger is an app that allows you create a burger and place an order. The front-end was made with React and I got to use Redux for easier state and data management.

I used Firebase for the back-end. 

This project helped make me more comfortable with React and it further enhanced my array and object manipulation skills as well as expose me to new and encouraged practices.
