My Burger is an app that allows you create a burger and place an order for the burger you created. The front-end was made with React and I got to use Redux for easier state and data management.
I employed Firebase for the back-end and it was a great addition for the project. 
This project helpeed made me more comfortable with React and it further enhanced my array and object manipulation skills as well as expose me to new and encouraged practices.
